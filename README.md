# README.md from tesla-app >>>> tesla-app-groovyscript
I folked this directory from Prof's Landmark repo. 
I deleted the old pom.xml file cos it did not have the tool to run sonar. Thus failed
In this newly copied pom.xml file, I changed the IP address to my private IP. 
I'll try to see if it will work. Sonarqube test failed - Ip or url not found
6/27/23 7:15am I got Sonarqube server running, In pom.xml file - I change my IP from private to public. Then re-run the build for jenkinsfile & it was SUCCESSFUL.
